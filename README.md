# Weather App

The Weather Android app is a handy tool designed to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information right at their fingertips. With a user-friendly interface and a range of features, this app allows users to check the current weather conditions, as well as the forecast for the upcoming days.

Upon opening the app, users are greeted with a visually appealing layout that displays the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant weather data. The app often utilizes location services to automatically detect the user's current location and provide them with localized weather information. Additionally, users can also manually search for specific cities or regions to get weather updates for those locations.
